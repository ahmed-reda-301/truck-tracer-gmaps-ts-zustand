# ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¦ Saudi Arabia Truck Tracking - Zustand Learning Project

**A comprehensive learning resource for Zustand state management in React with TypeScript**

This project demonstrates building a real-time truck tracking application for Saudi Arabia, with the primary focus on understanding **Zustand** concepts through practical implementation using real Saudi cities and routes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

This project is designed specifically for **learning Zustand** state management. It provides:

- **Real Saudi Arabia locations** - Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, Mecca, and more
- **Practical Zustand implementation** in a real-world scenario
- **Step-by-step state management** examples
- **TypeScript integration** with Zustand
- **Component composition** with shared state
- **Async actions** and loading states
- **Simplified codebase** focused on learning rather than complexity
- **Interactive map** with real truck routes between Saudi cities

## ðŸ“š What You'll Learn

### Core Zustand Concepts

1. **Store Creation** - How to create and configure Zustand stores
2. **State Management** - Managing complex application state
3. **Actions** - Implementing synchronous and asynchronous actions
4. **Selectors** - Optimizing component re-renders with selectors
5. **TypeScript Integration** - Type-safe state management
6. **DevTools** - Debugging with Zustand DevTools

### Practical Implementation

- Real-time data loading and updates
- Component state sharing
- Loading and error states
- Complex state updates
- Performance optimization

## ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡¦ Saudi Arabia Features

### Real Locations

- **Riyadh** - Capital city and major logistics hub
- **Jeddah** - Red Sea port and commercial center

- **Hafr Al-Batin** - Northern border region

### Realistic Routes

- **Riyadh â†” Jeddah** - Main commercial highway (Highway 40)
- **Dammam â†” Riyadh** - Eastern corridor (Highway 40)
- **Jeddah â†” Mecca** - Pilgrimage route (Highway 40)
- **Tabuk â†” Riyadh** - Northern route
- **Abha â†” Jazan** - Southern mountain-coastal route

### Saudi Truck Features

- Arabic license plates (e.g., "Ø± Ù‚ Ø¨ 1234")
- Saudi company names
- Arabic driver names
- Real highway references in alerts
- Culturally appropriate status messages

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
