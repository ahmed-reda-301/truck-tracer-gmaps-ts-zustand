# Truck Tracer - Zustand Learning Project

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive learning resource for **Zustand** state management in React with TypeScript. It demonstrates building a real-time truck tracking application similar to FlightRadar24, focusing on understanding Zustand concepts through practical implementation.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Master Zustand fundamentals and advanced concepts
- Compare Zustand with other state management solutions
- Build a real-world application with complex state requirements
- Implement real-time data visualization with Google Maps
- Practice TypeScript integration with state management

## 🗂️ Data Structure

The application manages several types of data:

- **Trucks**: Vehicle information, current position, status
- **Routes**: Predefined paths with waypoints
- **Checkpoints**: Fixed monitoring points
- **Airports**: Aviation-related locations
- **Security Points**: Ministry of Interior checkpoints
- **Alerts**: Real-time notifications and warnings

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:ahmed-reda-301/truck-tracer-gmaps-ts-zustand.git
   cd truck-tracer-gmaps-ts-zustand
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start learning**:
   - Begin with `docs/zustand/01-fundamentals.md`
   - Follow the documentation in order
   - Implement examples as you learn

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
